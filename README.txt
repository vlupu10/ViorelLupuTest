Thanks for taking the time to do this test! The task is to create an individualized notepad
that is append only. Specifically we would like the user to be able to create entries that
consist of tags, text, and a timestamp. The user specifies one or more tags, some text, and the
timestamp is populated automatically. We would like to use local storage to store the entries.
We would also like to leverage the local storage to remember previous tags and to automatically
suggest them when typing in the tags field. Finally we want to it to look pretty, we don't want
to allow duplicate posts, and we want to optimize the rendering to only draw the minimal amount
necessary when adding a post.

To this end you can use whatever libraries you want, whatever frameworks you want, and you can
change the index.html, script.js, and style.css files however you see fit to best achieve the
task. You can even use a css extension language like sass if you want.

You have three hours. Don't worry if you don't finish everything, just do your best and prioritize
the things you feel add the most value. If you need some extra time to reach a complete solution,
then go for it; but please provide an explanation in your submission.

If you have any questions, feel free to email us. Once you are complete, zip up the solution and
upload it to the google drive folder mentioned in the email that you received to start this test.
