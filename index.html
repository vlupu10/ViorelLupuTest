	*   Thanks for taking the time to do this test! The task is to create an individualized notepad
	*	that is append only. Specifically we would like the user to be able to create entries that
	*	consist of tags, text, and a timestamp. The user specifies one or more tags, some text, and the
	*	timestamp is populated automatically. We would like to use local storage to store the entries.
	*	We would also like to leverage the local storage to remember previous tags and to automatically
	*	suggest them when typing in the tags field. Finally we want to it to look pretty, we don't want
	*	to allow duplicate posts, and we want to optimize the rendering to only draw the minimal amount
	*	necessary when adding a post.
	*
	*	To this end you can use whatever libraries you want, whatever frameworks you want, and you can
	*	change the index.html, script.js, and style.css files however you see fit to best achieve the
	*	task. You can even use a css extension language like sass if you want.
	*	
	*	You have three hours. Don't worry if you don't finish everything, just do your best and prioritize
	*	the things you feel add the most value. If you need some extra time to reach a complete solution,
	*	then go for it; but please provide an explanation in your submission.
	*	
	*	If you have any questions, feel free to email us. Once you are complete, zip up the solution and
	*	upload it to the google drive folder mentioned in the email that you received to start this test.
	*
